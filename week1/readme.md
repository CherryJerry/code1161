TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

During the first week of CODE1161, I have learnt that although technology has been vastly improving, it seems that it cannot grasp the basics without the aid of input commands. This includes:
- what programs we force them to run
- What operations we want them to perform
- How we want them to complete the task

Summing this all up, computer technology cannot run by itself. Although it is smarter and faster than us, they cannot perform any tasks without the confirmation from the administrator.

During the first week of CODE1161, some things I found confusing in the tutorial were:
- The slide instructions as they didn't specifically show what the students will see when executing those steps.
- The required equipment for the class. This was not really a problem because bringing a computer is mandatory for "computational design" but since there is no moodle page for this unit, we did not know what we had to do, what to bring, etc.
- How we should use github. Spending nearly three hours just to install the programs and set everything up was unpractical. I am still unsure on how I should approach the site and how to check the course outline and what to expect for the following weeks.
